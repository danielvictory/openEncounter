# openEncounter
[A tabletop encounter builder CRUD app using RESTful routes.](https://open-encounter.herokuapp.com/)

A simple, savable tool for running your tabletop encounters over and over, 
ad naseum, 
as much as you like, 
until your dice rolling hand falls off.

## Adventuring Gear
HTML
CSS
Javascript
node.js
express
express-sessions
MongoDB
Mongoose

## Gettin' Rollin'
On landing, either 
1. sign-in, 
2. sign-up, 
3. see what others are encountering, or
4. start your own (unsaved) encounter!

If you are logged in to an account, you will be able to save encounters and display them publicly or privately.

These encounters can be editted at will to add or remove players or adversaries.`

## Lookin' Good


## Awaiting Initiative
1. Add Adversary data
2. Link Adversary data to dropdowns to add to encounters
3. Display Adversary stats
4. Create player model with stats relevant to encounters
5. Create a "run" dashboard so the encounter can be controlled in window.

Down the road: Gotta make sure that public facing encounters are not abused by adversarial users.
